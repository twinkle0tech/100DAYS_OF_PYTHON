# 🐍 Python Day 6 - Reeborg's World Maze Solver

This project is my **Day 6 challenge** from the **100 Days of Code: Python** course.

I solved the **Maze problem** in Reeborg's World using Python logic and conditions.

---

##  What This Code Does

- Moves the robot forward until it finds a wall  
- Turns left to start solving the maze  
- Uses the **Right-Hand Rule Algorithm**:
- If the right side is clear → turn right and move  
- Else if front is clear → move forward  
- Else → turn left

##  Learning Outcome

- Functions in Python

- While loops

- If / elif / else conditions

- Problem solving using algorithm thinking
