##  How It Works

- The program asks the user for the first number.

- It shows all available operations.

- The user selects an operation and enters the next number.

- The result is shown.

- The user can:

   - type y to continue with the same result, or

   - type n to start a new calculation.

## Note

- This program uses a dictionary to store operations and functions.

- It also uses recursion to restart the calculator when the user chooses a new calculation.
