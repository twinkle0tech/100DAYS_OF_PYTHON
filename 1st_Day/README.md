# Day 1 – Band Name Generator 🎸

This is a beginner Python exercise from my **100 Days of Python** learning journey.
---
## Concepts Practiced
- User input
- String concatenation
- Basic Python syntax
---
### print
-- we can display thing of word in the screen using the print system
print("hello world")
---
## string manipulation
-- Use \n to add another line of "Hello world".

`print("Hello\nWorld")` 

--  Use the plus symbol `+` to concatenate different strings together

`print("My name is" + " " + "muskan")`
---
### inputs 
-- This line of code will take an input using the input() function
`print("Hello " + input("What is your name?") + "!")`
---
### variable
`username = input("What is your name?")`
`length = len(username)`
`print(length)`
---
### variablee naming
- Rules
- Make sure your variable names are descriptive
- Don't have spaces between words
- Don't start with numbers
- Don't use special words like print or input
- Choose simple words that are less likely to become typos
- Check the company style guidelines if you start work at a company
`name = "muskan"`
`length = len(name)`
`print(length)`
