✅ Caesar Cipher (Python)

This is a simple Caesar Cipher program made using Python.
It can encode (encrypt) and decode (decrypt) messages by shifting letters in the alphabet.

🚀 Features

✅ Encode text (encryption)
✅ Decode text (decryption)
✅ Works with spaces, numbers, and symbols (they stay unchanged)
✅ Loop option to run again and again

🛠️ How It Works

You enter a message

You enter a shift number

The program shifts each letter by that number
Example:
hello with shift 3 → khoor

▶️ How To Run

Make sure Python is installed.

Run the program:

python main.py

📌 Example
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
hello
Type the shift number:
5
Here is the encoded result: mjqqt
